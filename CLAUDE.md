# CLAUDE.md — Cleveland Business Mentors CRM Implementation

This file provides guidance for Claude when working on the Cleveland
Business Mentors CRM implementation.

## First — Read the Process Guide

Before doing any work in this repository, read the Document Production
Process section in the CRM Builder CLAUDE.md:

```
https://github.com/dbower44022/crmbuilder/blob/main/CLAUDE.md
```

The full process specification is:

```
https://github.com/dbower44022/crmbuilder/blob/main/PRDs/application/CRM-Builder-Document-Production-Process.docx
```

That document defines the required sequence for producing all CRM
implementation documents. Following it is mandatory. Do not skip steps
or produce documents out of sequence.

## This Repository

This is the **Cleveland Business Mentors (CBM)** client implementation
repository. It contains all PRD documents, YAML program files, and
generated documentation for the CBM CRM implementation.

CBM is a nonprofit organization providing free business mentoring and
education to entrepreneurs, small businesses, and nonprofits in
Northeast Ohio.

## Current Implementation State

**Process status: Mentoring domain process documents complete; other domains pending.**

The Mentoring (MN) domain has five completed process documents produced
under the new document production process. Other domains remain in
transition from the old process.

### Mentoring Domain Process Documents (new process)

| Document | File | Version |
|---|---|---|
| Client Intake | `PRDs/MN/MN-INTAKE.docx` | v2.1 |
| Mentor Matching | `PRDs/MN/MN-MATCH.docx` | v2.1 |
| Engagement Management | `PRDs/MN/MN-ENGAGE.docx` | v2.3 |
| Activity Monitoring | `PRDs/MN/MN-INACTIVE.docx` | v1.2 |
| Engagement Closure | `PRDs/MN/MN-CLOSE.docx` | v1.1 |

**Latest structural change (04-01-26):** Added Primary Engagement
Contact field to the Engagement entity across all five documents. This
field identifies the single client contact who is the primary point of
contact for a specific engagement. All system-generated client-facing
communications follow a TO/CC pattern: addressed TO the Primary
Engagement Contact, with other Engagement Contacts (if any) as CC.
This is distinct from the organization-level Primary Contact on
Client Contact.

**Remaining MN work:** Client Satisfaction Tracking (MN-SURVEY) process
document, workflow diagrams for all processes, and Domain Reconciliation.

### Existing Documents (produced under old process)

| Document | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Master PRD | `PRDs/CBM-Master-PRD.md` | Markdown, v1.0 — needs conversion to Word and review |
| Mentoring Domain PRD | `PRDs/CBM-Domain-PRD-Mentoring.md` | Markdown, v1.0 — superseded by process documents above |
| Mentor Recruitment Domain PRD | `PRDs/CBM-Domain-PRD-MentorRecruitment.md` | Markdown, v1.0 — summary-level data, needs enrichment |
| Client Recruiting Domain PRD | `PRDs/CBM-Domain-PRD-ClientRecruiting.md` | Markdown, v1.0 — summary-level data, needs enrichment |
| Fundraising Domain PRD | `PRDs/CBM-Domain-PRD-Fundraising.md` | Markdown, v1.0 — summary-level data, needs enrichment |
| Consolidated Design | `PRDs/CBM-Consolidated-Design.md` | Markdown, v2.0 — eliminated as separate document in new process |

### Legacy Documents

All documents from prior iterations are in `PRDs/Archive/`. These are
source material only — never reference them as current requirements.

### Next Steps

- Define Client Satisfaction Tracking (MN-SURVEY) process document
- Create workflow diagrams for all five MN processes
- Conduct Mentoring Domain Reconciliation
- Begin Mentor Recruitment (MR) domain process documents
- Convert Master PRD from Markdown to Word

## Important Rules for This Implementation

- Never mention specific product names (EspoCRM, WordPress, Moodle,
  Constant Contact, DigitalOcean, etc.) in Master PRDs, process
  documents, or Domain PRDs. These are implementation details only.
- All documents are produced as Word (.docx) files. No Markdown
  source files under the new process.
- All legacy documents are in `PRDs/Archive/` — never reference them
  as current requirements. They are source material only.
- Update this CLAUDE.md file to reflect current implementation state
  at the end of every work session.
